function Add_Pather ( root_Folder_Name_or_Address )

% This Program Adds all Folders in the 'root_Folder_Name_or_Address'

% Case 1: 'Full Input'
    %       If you write the full address of  root folder ( root_Folder_Name_or_Address ), 
    %       no matter where this folder is, this program will search all subfolders of that folder 
    %       to find the address of target folder (the_Name_of_Target_Folder). 
    %
    %     For example: 
    %                   [ target_Folder_Address, Explanation ] = Folder_Address_Extractor ( 'U:\Matlab_2011', 'Amin' );

% Case 2: 'Root Name'    
    %       But, if you write just the name of root folder (root_Folder_Name_or_Address), this program 
    %       will seach all the folders in the current branch of this program, for searching the address 
    %       of target folder (the_Name_of_Target_Folder). 
    %
    %       For example: If this program is in the Follwoing branch: 
    %                    U:\MAHAB\Ph.D._Files\Matlab_Learning\Classification\Supervised\1_Bayesian_Decision_Method
    %                    and we just call the program:            Folder_Address_Extractor ( 'Matlab_Learning', 'Tools' ) 
    %                    This pro will search all the subfolders of 'Matlab_Learning' folder to find the 'Tools' folder.

% Case 3: ' 'Empty Root'    
    %       If we leave the 'root_Folder_Name_or_Address' empty, it will be replaced with the drive 
    %       which contains the program ( eg. : U:\ )
    %
    %       For example: If this program is in the Follwoing branch: 
    %                    U:\MAHAB\Ph.D._Files\Matlab_Learning\Classification\Supervised\1_Bayesian_Decision_Method
    %
    %                   [ target_Folder_Address, Explanation ] = Folder_Address_Extractor ( '', 'Tools' );
    %                    This pro will search all the subfolders of 'Matlab_Learning' folder to find the 'Tools' folder.

% Output:      
    %       How to Show the results of this Program:
    %              [ target_Folder_Address, Explanation ] = Folder_Address_Extractor ( 'Matlab_Learning', 'Folder' );
